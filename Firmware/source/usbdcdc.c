 *
 * Some assumptions and deviations from the CDC specification
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 1.  Although the CDC specification indicates that the following requests
 * should be supported by ACM CDC devices, these don't seem relevant to a
 * virtual COM port implementation and are never seen when connecting to a
 * Windows host and running either Hyperterminal or TeraTerm.  As a result,
 * this implementation does not support them and stalls endpoint 0 if they are
 * received.
 *          - SEND_ENCAPSULATED_COMMAND
 *          - GET_ENCAPSULATED_RESPONSE
 *          - SET_COMM_FEATURE
 *          - GET_COMM_FEATURE
 *          - CLEAR_COMM_FEATURE
 *
 * 2.  The CDC specification is very clear on the fact that an ACM device
 * should offer two interfaces - a control interface offering an interrupt IN
 * endpoint and a data interface offering bulk IN and OUT endpoints.  Using
 * this descriptor configuration, however, Windows insists on enumerating the
 * device as two separate entities resulting in two virtual COM ports or one
 * COM port and an Unknown Device (depending upon INF contents) appearing
 * in Device Manager.  This implementation, derived by experimentation and
 * examination of other virtual COM and CDC solutions, uses only a single
 * interface combining all three endpoints.  This appears to satisfy
 * Windows2000, XP and Vista and operates as intended using the Hyperterminal
 * and TeraTerm terminal emulators.  Your mileage may vary with other
 * (untested) operating systems!

     *
     * 1.  Errors (overrun, parity, framing error) are ORed together so that
     *     any reported error is sent on the next notification.
     * 2.  Signal line states (RI, break, TX carrier, RX carrier) always
     *     report the last state notified to us.  The implementation here will
     *     send an interrupt showing the last state but, if two state changes
     *     occur very quickly, the host may receive a notification containing
     *     the same state that was last reported (in other words, a short pulse
     *     will be lost).  It would be possible to reduce the likelihood of
     *     this happening by building a queue of state changes and sending
     *     these in order but you are left with exactly the same problem if the
     *     queue fills up.  For now, therefore, we run the risk of missing very
     *     short pulses on the "steady-state" signal lines.
